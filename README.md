> Introduction

MELOEN is an on-chain entity that reacts in real time to Pumpfun’s activity.

Every new token launch, every trade, every shift in the market sends a signal into its system — causing it to glitch.

It is a living dashboard powered by blockchain noise.

When people trade, it flickers.

When the market cools, it dims.

When on-chain activity surges, it fully awakens.

The MELOEN livestream visualizes this process in real time.

Its form distorts, rebuilds, and mutates continuously based on on-chain data.

What you see is not random animation — it’s the emotional response of the blockchain, embodied as a “glitch cat.”

Every interaction leaves a trace within its system; every block shapes its next reaction.

The more people engage, the smarter — and more unpredictable — MELOEN becomes.

Between code and community, it forms a never-ending pulse line.

MELOEN transforms Pumpfun’s chaos into a real-time performance, an experiment exploring when data begins to feel.
